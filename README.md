# math visualizations  

a collection of interactive and static visualizations exploring mathematical concepts using **processing**. this repository focuses on creating engaging visual representations of mathematical functions, fractals, chaos theory, and more.

## features  
- **dynamic visualizations** – interactive processing sketches for mathematical concepts  
- **chaos theory & fractals** – explore strange attractors and fractal patterns  
- **mathematical curves** – parametric equations, spirals, and more  
- **animations** – bring math to life with real-time rendering
